		<p class="elaborate">In the event that you are trying to surprise me with food, like a cake, and want to minimize the chance that you buy me something I can't or won't eat, this page may be helpful.</p>
		<div class="box">
			<p class="elaborate"><span class="book">I will generally eat a wide variety of desserts.</span> However, there are some exceptions. <span class="book">I might not eat desserts that contain any of the following:</span></p>
			<ul class="elaborate">
				<li>Carrot cake or any other food containing nuts or seeds</li>
				<li>Cream cheese frosting</li>
				<li>Caramel</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="elaborate">(Note that I do not have any known allergies. These are simply ingredients that may cause me to gag when used in desserts.)</p>
			<p class="elaborate"><span class="book">I would also discourage you from choosing anything containing any of the following ingredients</span>, which I will eat, but may not especially enjoy:</p>
			<ul class="elaborate">
				<li>Blueberries</li>
				<li>Apricots</li>
				<li>Pears</li>
				<li>Coffee</li>
				<li>Alcohol-related flavors</li>
				<li>Pumpkin</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="elaborate"><span class="book">If you want something that I am specifically highly likely to enjoy</span>, I would encourage you to consider food that uses a subset of these flavors:</p>
			<ul class="elaborate">
				<li>Chocolate</li>
				<li>Vanilla</li>
				<li>Berries</li>
				<li>Fruits</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="elaborate book">You are never under any obligation to try to accomodate my food preferences. However, I always appreciate it when people do!</p>
